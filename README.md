## ‚úÖ Description

_This a web application that will allow users to play a mafia themed styled hidden role game. Simply put, the objective of the game is for the mafia to ‚Äúkill‚Äù civilians until they are the majority, or for the civilians to kill off the entire mafia. When one of those two things happens, the game is over._

### MVP

- Basic game default settings
- Game logic decides roles based off of the amount of players
- A Help section and or tutorial for first time players
- A flowchart of the game and how to win(Readme)
- A user should be able to host a game
- A user should be able to join a game with an access code
- A clean & easy UI to interact with
- A manual "ready" button to move game forward
- A tooltip for roles to help remind players what their role can/can't do
- A group of user should be able to successfully start and complete a game

### Stretch Goals

[] A simple tutorial toggle with persisted user preferences
[] Customizable settings
[] Mini games between rounds
[] SMS/Email invites
[] A timer
[] Custom Themes
[] In-game communication/Chat
