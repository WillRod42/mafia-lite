## üìù Summary <a id="summary"></a>

_This is a full stack application that uses prisma and postgresql for the backend, node/express for the server, and react for the front-end and is written using typescript._

## ‚úÖ Description <a id="description"></a>

_This is a web application that will allow a group of users to play a lovecraftian-styled hidden role game. It largely based off the popular games of Mafia, Werewolf and The Townspeople. The objective of the game is for the cultists to ‚Äúkill‚Äù investigators until they are the majority, or for the investigators to kill off all the cultists. When one of those two things happens, the game is over and the respective faction wins!._

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation, Setup, and Running The App <a id="installation-setup-and-running-the-app"></a>

### Setup/Installation Requirements <a id="installation"></a>

- _Please ensure you have the latest version of NodeJs and PostgreSQL_
- _Clone this repository <https://github.com/eyecuelab/mafia-lite> locally_
- _Navigate to the root folder `mafia-lite` and then `cd api` and run `npm install` and then `cd client` and run `npm install`_.
- See below for required .env files
- You will also need to have your database setup in PostgreSQL
- To ensure the prisma schema has been updated to PostgreSQL, Run a migration to create your database tables with Prisma Migrate:
  - `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
  - `npm run seed` to seed the database with the default roles
- Also, Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database.
  - Run `npx prisma studio` in your terminal.

### Required .env Files <a id="required-files"></a>

- In the `/api` directory, create an .env file and insert the following: `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:yourPasswordGoesHere@localhost:5432/yourDatabaseNameGoesHere?schema=yourSchemaNameGoesHere"` & `SESSION_SECRET="yourSecretGoesHere"`
- Then save
- In the `/client` directory, create an .env file (separate from the previous), and insert the following: `VITE_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000`
- Then save

### Running the App Locally <a id="running-the-app-locally"></a>

- Split your terminal into two separate consoles
- Navigate one terminal into the `/api` directory and run `npm run dev`
- Navigate the second terminal into the `/client` directory and run `npm run dev` as well. If your browser does not automatically load, type `http://localhost:5173/` manually in the browser
